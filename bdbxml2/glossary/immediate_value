    The one in ((variable|Variable)) that not ((reference|Reference))
    but actual value is stored.
    Only '((|Fixnum|))' and ((|nil|))/((|true|))/((|false|)) are
    immediate values in present ((Ruby)).
    However, there's no law against another ((Ruby))
    which ((|Fixnum|)) is not immediate value, and also you can regard
    the all values on the model as a ((reference|Reference))
    to the ((object|Object)).
