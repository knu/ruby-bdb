    One of which ((Ruby)) doesn't have.

    Why ((|goto|))'s absent is not for the policy "it should not be anywhere,"
    but for the fact "it's troublesome in implementation."
    In place of ((|goto|)), ((|catch|))/((|throw|))
    or the ((exception|Exception)) is used\ in ((Ruby)).

    See also "((Non-Local Exit))."
