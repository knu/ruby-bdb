    ((Object))

    There seems to be a meaning to emphasize belonging to the class
    where the object exists.
    It is heard that there are a lot of people who have failed
    in ((object-oriented|Object-Oriented)) ((paradigm|Paradigm))
    by confusing whether the one s/he touches is an object or an instance.
