    Do you arrange four byte ((data|Data)) 0x1234
    with 1, 2, 3, 4? or 4, 3, 2, 1?
    The former way is called ((Big Endian)),
    and the latter is called ((Little Endian)).
    The controversy which is good continues from the preliterate era
    and till now the conclusion has not been reached yet.
