    The group of a certain code which can be passed to the ((method|Method))
    is called '((block|Block)).'
    Iterator is the method which the given block...this is surely the case.
    In general, the block is executed more than one time, so the method is
    called 'iterator' ("iterate" = repeat it); but there is a custom
    to call the case executing only once or not repeating, also iterator,
    insofar as the block is given to the method.
    Keep in mind, just the method have the 'repetition' as many as 0 or 1 time,
    do not call it liar, because it must be the 'repetition.'

    In the iterator, you can execute the block by '((|yield|)).'

    Ah, of course
    Nothing happens to the metho
    when the block is given of not evaluating the block internally.
    I wish you not to disappoint though the error does not occur either.
