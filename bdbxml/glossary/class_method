    ((Method)) of class.
    It is defined in class Class of all classes.
    Though there is a method which is common in all classes
    and a ((singleton method|Singleton Method))
    which is proper to each class.
    that's not much of a problem.
    Do not misunderstand than
    '((|((self))|))' in the class method is a class.
