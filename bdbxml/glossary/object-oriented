    ((In Japanese|Japanese (language))),
    an adjective "Object-Oriented" has transcolored to an abstract noun,
    which means "the ((object|Object))-based ((paradigm|Paradigm))."

    Any kind of view looks OK at first
    as long as the object is the central concept,
    but in general, it seems that the ((paradigm|Paradigm)) needs
     * ((Inheritance)),
     * ((Encapsulation)),
     * and ((Polymorphism)) (or ((Dynamic Binding))).
    Someone deals it as a wild card or a kind of magic,
    but our life has a lot more.
    Twenty-odd years since the dawn, through all our fortunes,
    there comes to be a first stage of pragmatic use...perhaps...agreed?
