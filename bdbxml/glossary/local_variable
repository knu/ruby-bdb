    ((Variable)) which can be referred only within a certain range.
    The range is called 'Scope'. The scope of ((Ruby)) is among:

     * The entire program
     * Class and module definition
     * ((Method)) definition
     * ((Block))

    and only ((block|Block))
    can access the local variable in the outside scope.
    An effective range of the local variable is
    from the place where the first substitution in scope appeared
    to an end of the scope.
    The effective range is fixed statically, and is unrelated
    whether actually executed.
