# 
# The transaction subsystem makes operations atomic, consistent,
# isolated, and durable in the face of system and application
# failures. The subsystem requires that the data be properly logged and
# locked in order to attain these properties. Berkeley DB contains all
# the components necessary to transaction-protect the Berkeley DB access
# methods and other forms of data may be protected if they are logged
# and locked appropriately.
# 
# 
# The transaction subsystem is created, initialized, and opened by calls
# to <em>BDB::Env#open</em> with the <em>BDB::INIT_TXN</em>
# flag (or <em>BDB::INIT_TRANSACTION</em>) specified.
# Note that enabling transactions automatically enables
# logging, but does not enable locking, as a single thread of control
# that needed atomicity and recoverability would not require it.
# 
# The transaction is created with <em>BDB::Env#begin</em>
# or with <em>begin</em> 
class BDB::Txn
   
   #Abort the transaction. This is will terminate the transaction.
