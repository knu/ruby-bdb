 This is an interface to Berkeley DB, distributed by Sleepycat
 (http://www.sleepycat.com/)

* Prerequisite

  db >= 2 (some functionnality like join are not available with db < 2.6)

  For Berkeley DB 1.85 and 1.86 see bdb1

* Installation
 
   ruby extconf.rb
   make
   make install
 
 You may need to specify :

  --with-db-include=<include file directory for bdb>

  --with-db-lib=<library directory for bdb>

  --with-db-dir=<prefix for library and include of bdb>

  --help

 Example :
 
  ruby extconf.rb --with-db-dir=/home/ts/local

* WARNING

  With bdb >= 0.5.5 `nil' is stored as an empty string (when marshal is not
  used).

  Open the database with

     "store_nil_as_null" => true

  if you want the old behavior (`nil' stored as `\000')
