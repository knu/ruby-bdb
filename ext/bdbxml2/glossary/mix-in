    To make a new taste mixing various one with the ice cream.
    Changed into mix the module with the class,
    and add the ((function|Function)).
    See also "((Inheritance))."

    Multiple ((inheritance|Inheritance)) is not adopted in ((Ruby)).
    Instead, the inheritance for the is-a relation,
    and Mix-in for sharing the ((function|Function)) is prepared.
    The purpose of this is the belief of ((matz))
    that the relations should be in chaos when multiple inheritance is abused.
