    Operation to ((object|Object)).
    You can refer to the object ((receiver|Receiver))
    to be operated with ((self)).
    In ((Ruby)), if you exclude the object
    of a ((built-in class|Built-In Class)),
    since the structure of the object is dynamically determined,
    the character of a certain object is determined
    by the method defined in the object.
