<name>Environment Variable</name>
<content>
    Value which is delivered from parent process to offspring process.
    It is accessed with ((|((ENV))|)).
    What is delivered to the offspring process is
    a copy of the environment ((variable|Variable)),
    so it is not possible to pass informations
    from the offspring process to the parent
    by using the environment variable.
    The parent will not listen to the child.
