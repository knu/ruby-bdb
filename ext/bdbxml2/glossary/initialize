    Put the ((object|Object)) (or "something")
    into "ready-to-use-it" state.
    The '((|initialize|))' ((method|Method)) should be redefined
    to initialize the ((instance|Instance)).
    The default definition of the method '((|new|))' of the class is
    to execute Initialize to the newly generated instance.
    The argument to ((|new|)) is tossed to initialize as it is.
    Moreover, when ((|new|)) is called with the ((block|Block)),
    the block is given to initialize as it is.

    This surely means Class#new is not to have to be redefined.
