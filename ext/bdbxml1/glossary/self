    Expression which refers to ((receiver|Receiver)).

    Why it's called '((|self|))'?
    By one account, the ((receiver|Receiver)) is the subject of the sentence
    where ((method|Method)) is the verb, so from the method's standpoint
    it's itself, though it is strongly suspected that it's the mimic
    of ((Smalltalk)) without deep account.
