    To hide the algorithm of an internal structure and processing from outside,
    by the immediate operation to ((data|Data)) only from a specific procedure
    (called the ((method|Method))) which accompanies the type of data.
    See also "((Abstract Data Type))."

    since it is impossible to refer to the ((instance variable|Instance Variable)) from non-method.
