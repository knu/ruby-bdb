    A bunch of data structure and operation to the ((data|Data))
    is called an abstract data type.

    The abstract data should not be operated unless passing this operation.
    As a result, it is not referred directly from the outside,
    and the change in an internal structure does not color the outside.
    This is called ((encapsulation|Encapsulation)).
