    Strictly speaking, ((Ruby)) has no functions.
    But the appearance of a method call with ((receiver|Receiver)) left out
    is like a function, and furthermore, there is a ((method|Method)) which
    we can describe it as a virtual function, ((|((self))|)),
    ((instance variable|Instance Variable)),
    where no ((receiver|Receiver)) informations are referred.
    Such methods are sometimes, in a torelant situation, called functions.

    Mostly such function(al method)s' visibility is set to private, so that
    they could not be called in the form which ((receiver|Receiver)) is
    not omitted.
    The representative of that methods is ((module function|Module Function)).
